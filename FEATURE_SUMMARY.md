# Historical Load Comparison - Feature Summary

## 🎯 Overview

This feature adds comprehensive historical load comparison capabilities to the load interpretability model. It enables users to compare current load patterns with historical data, understand changes in load behavior, and get human-behavior-based explanations for differences.

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented and tested.

## 📋 Problem Statement (Chinese)

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Stage Count Comparison
Analyzes changes in the number of load stages and explains why they increased or decreased.

**Example Output:**
```
Current stages: 24
Historical stages: 28
Change: -4 stages (-14.3%)
Trend: 减少 (Decreasing)

Reasons:
  1. 用电行为更加规律，负荷模式简化
  2. 家庭成员减少或外出时间增加
  3. 减少了用电设备使用或优化了用电习惯
```

### 2. Stage Alignment
Matches stages between current and historical data using time-based overlap algorithm.

**Features:**
- Time overlap priority
- Center-point distance calculation
- One-to-one stage matching

### 3. Environmental Feature Integration
Combines load data with environmental factors for comprehensive analysis.

**Tracked Features:**
- Temperature (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- Cloud Cover (0-1)

### 4. Significant Difference Detection
Automatically identifies stages with load differences exceeding 20%.

**Example Output:**
```
Stage 4 (7.2h-9.0h): +0.557 kW (+27.8%)
  Type: 增加 (Increase)
```

### 5. Human Behavior Explanations
Provides time-specific behavioral interpretations for each difference.

**Time Periods:**
- Night (0-6h)
- Morning Peak (6-9h)
- Morning (9-12h)
- Noon (12-14h)
- Afternoon (14-18h)
- Evening Peak (18-22h)
- Late Night (22-24h)

**Example Explanation:**
```
早高峰时段负荷增加，可能是：
  • 起床时间提前
  • 早餐准备更复杂
  • 增加了热水器/咖啡机使用
```

### 6. Comprehensive Visualization
8-subplot chart showing complete comparison analysis.

**Subplots:**
1. Current load curve with stages
2. Historical load curve with stages
3. Stage count bar chart
4. Aligned stage load comparison
5. Load difference percentage
6. Significant differences summary
7. Temperature comparison
8. Behavior analysis

## 📊 Example Outputs

### Report Structure
```
▶ Stage Count Comparison
  Current: 24, Historical: 28, Change: -4 (-14.3%)

▶ Aligned Stage Analysis
  Stage 4 ↔ Stage 6:

## 💻 Code Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from train_household_forecast import compare_with_historical_stages

# Your data
current_segments = [...]
historical_segments = [...]
current_feat_df = pd.DataFrame(...)
historical_feat_df = pd.DataFrame(...)

# Run comparison
comparison = compare_with_historical_stages(
    current_segments, historical_segments,
    current_feat_df, historical_feat_df,
    current_times, historical_times,
    current_load, historical_load
)

# Access results
print(comparison['stage_count_comparison'])
print(comparison['aligned_stages'])
print(comparison['significant_differences'])
print(comparison['behavior_explanations'])
```

### With Report Generation
```python
from train_household_forecast import (
    compare_with_historical_stages,
    generate_explanation_report
)

# Run comparison
comparison = compare_with_historical_stages(...)

# Generate report
explanations = {
    'historical_comparison': comparison
}
generate_explanation_report(explanations, 'report.txt')
```
